        <h2>CRYSTAL WYVERN</h2>
        <h3>Crystal Wyverns appear very similar to what one would assume to be a stereotypical dragon. There are three different types of Crystal Wyverns, each with small but distinguishable variations in size, shape and color.
            Each variant has a distinct color palette that resembles their respective biomes. Blood Crystal Wyverns appear with much more of a reddish hue compared to Ember Crystal Wyverns, which are more yellowish.</h3>

A bit stronger than Prime, stats-wise, and uses buffs that makes them stronger than InDominus as well. These creatures are more DPS centric rather than being tanky so sometimes they might be more of a side-grade rather than an upgrade from their Prime/InDominus counterpart as they are more role specific than them.</h3>
